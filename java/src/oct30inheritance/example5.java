/*
Only non-static member are participating in inheritance


to achieve inheritance we need constructor chaining
	- when child class constructor calls parent class constructor and parent class constructor calls its parent class constructor
	  that is known as constructor chaining
	- this is possible by using super()
	- super()
		- its known as parent class instance
		- will help you to call immediate parent class constructor based on the parameter
	
Parent class-> super class/base class
child class -> subclass/inherited class
